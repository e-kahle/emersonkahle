						<div class="aboutAtext">
							My name is Emerson Kahle, and I am a 20 year-old undergraduate
							junior from the Boston area. I love to play sports, specifically
							soccer and basketball, and I am a die-hard Boston sports fan. I am
							currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a
							Bachelor of Science in Applied and Computational Mathematics from
							the University of Southern California (Fight On!). I expect to
							graduate with both degrees in May of 2025.

						<div class="aboutQtext">What are my interests?</div>
						<div class="aboutAtext">
							From as young as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by
							numbers and patterns. In my early childhood, this fascination
							drove me towards a passion for chess. As I got older and learned
							more about mathematics, my interests shifted to better
							understanding the mathematical patterns underlying the behavior of
							human institutions. Recognizing computer science as the best field
							for applying mathematical theory to build such understanding, I
							decided to study CS alongside applied math. Now, my interests
							primarily concern using my technical skills to create real-world
							impact or provide real-world insight through software engineering,
							data science/statistics, and machine learning.

					<div class="aboutFlexRow">
						<div class="aboutQtext">What are my goals?</div>
						<div class="aboutAtext">
							For the majority of my career, I intend to establish myself in
							industry working in one of the aforementioned fields at the
							intersection of mathematics and computer science. I believe that
							working for companies whose survival is predicated on leveraging
							mathematical/computational theories and/or patterns to create
							real-world impact will best build the base of technical knowledge
							that supports my interests. At the end of my career, I hope to
							utilize this knowledge base to increase engagement with math among
							the youth. I firmly believe that the true test of oneâ€™s
							understanding is their ability to effectively and adaptively
							explain supposedly understood concepts to a variety of listeners.
							In school and personal projects, this often leads me to explain my
							ideas to my peers in detail to validate my own understanding. For
							this reason, after building a strong base of applied technical
							knowledge through education and industry, I want to share and
							motivate that knowledge with the young minds of the next
							generations by teaching at the high school or undergraduate level.
